# VBA-challenge

Hello, 

I encountered many issues with Excel during this challenge and haven't been able to fully put my codes to test due to it freezing almost every time. For this reason, it might contain some errors that I am not aware of even though I believe I did get the main idea right for most of the tasks. 

This is also the reason why I am not able to provide any screenshots as running VBA on my computer was nearly impossible, however, I followed the provided screenshots' layouts to write my codes so the values are as follow: 

  - Ticker in column I/9
  - Yearly Change in column J/10
  - Percent Change in column K/11
  - Total Stock Volume in column L/12

And for the second part of the exercise:

  - Ticker and Value in columns P/16 and Q/17
  - Greater % of Increase, Greater % of Decrease and Greatest Total Volume respectively in 02,03 and 04 meaning that Script 2 values are coded to run through P2:Q4 cells.

Please let me know if I could eventually resubmit this challenge later once I will be able to try the codes on another device.

Thank you!
